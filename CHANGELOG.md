## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Added cleanUpTmx parameter to LocalizationManager.DeleteOldTranslationFiles to allow for cleanup of old TMX files.

### Removed

- TMX-based localization no longer supported
- LocalizationManager.GetTranslationFileNameForLanguage is no longer public.

## [5.0.0] - 2022-07-08

### Added

- option `LocalizationManager.ThrowIfManagerDisposed` to not throw if LM disposed (BL-9904)
- XliffBody.TransUnitsUnordered for where you just need to enumerate all of them.
- (Made public) XliffBody.AddTransUnit and .RemoveTransUnit for where you need to modify.
- XliffBody.TransUnitsForXml. This is necessarily public to support (backwards-compatible)
    serialization and deserialization in XML, but is not intended for any other purpose.

### Changed

- remove progress dialog when initializating Xliff localization managers (BL-11157)
- Made string retrieval operations on Xliff-based LocalizationManagers thread-safe
- Added ILocalizationManager parameter to StringsLocalizedHandler
- It's long been a convention that xliff file names are module.lang.xlf (e.g., Bloom.fr.xlf)
or else kept in language-code folders (.../en/Bloom.xlf) if UseLanguageCodeFolders is set.
With the latest changes, this is required: the language name indicated in these ways in the file
name must match the language declared in the target-language attribute, or at least match the
first element of the target-language (e.g., a file with target-languge es-ES may be stored in
file like Bloom.es.xlf or .../es/Bloom.xlf).
- Progress dialogs are no longer shown when initializing XLIFF-based LocalizationManagers.
- Made it possible for caller to specify the file extension of the "original" executable file
when constructing an XLIFF-based LocalizationManager.
- Changed the way the "original" attribute is set in XLIFF files. It used to be based on the
Name, but changed it to use Id instead.
- Added optional owner parameter to methods that show dialog boxes so that they can be
displayed centered on a parent window (and not appear off-screen).

### Removed

- XliffBody.TransUnits, as there is no good way to make this thread-safe for all the ways
    it could be used, such as adding items to the list. (See Added for replacements.)

## [4.1.0] - 2021-03-04

### Changed

- Add `ExtractXliff` tool as nuget package
- Add `CheckOrFixXliff` tool as nuget package
- Added version of LocalizationManager.Create to allow "custom" localization methods
- Added -m switch to ExtractXliff command-line to allow caller to pass additional string-localization methods

## [4.0.3] - 2020-01-21

### Changed

- Add build number to AssemblyFileVersion

## [4.0.2] - 2019-07-09

### Fixed

- If translator returns an unmodified source string, don't substitute the English language name for the vernacular name.

## [4.0.1] - 2019-07-08

### Added

- create symbol nuget package

### Fixed

- Find TMX files in `Generated` and `User Modified` directories

- Don't ask Bing translator to translate language names: https://github.com/sillsdev/l10nsharp/issues/66.
  Also don't display the name a second time in parentheses if English and native name are identical.

## [4.0.0] - 2019-05-16

### Changed

- Allow to select translation memory (TMX or XLIFF). This changed a few APIs.
  To create a `LocalizationManager` you now pass a `TranslationMemory` parameter
  (cf. [migration](https://github.com/sillsdev/l10nsharp/wiki/Migration) guide):

      LocalizationManager.Create(TranslationMemory.XLiff, lang, "SampleApp", "SampleApp",
        Application.ProductVersion, directoryOfInstalledXliffFiles, "MyCompany/L10NSharpSample",
        icon, "sample@example.com", "SampleApp");

- Nuget package is now called `L10NSharp` instead of `L10NSharp.xliff` or `L10NSharp.tmx`

## [3.1.1] - 2019-04-26

### Fixed

- Create .exe for `CheckOrFixXliff` and `ExtractXliff` instead of .dll

## [3.1.0] - 2019-04-16

### Changed

- Create nuget package
- Strong-name assembly
